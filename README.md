# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
Welcome to my inaugural project in the front-end web developer bootcamp! This endeavor served as a practical exploration of HTML and CSS, specifically honing my skills in naming divs, incorporating alt attributes for images, transitioning from divs to semantic elements, and understanding the nuances of display properties like inline, inline-block, and block.

In the course of this project, students were furnished with essential project files, allowing us to implement the necessary updates. Additionally, we delved into the intricacies of deploying files and navigating the terminal using commands such as git add ., git commit -m "<message>", and git push origin main to seamlessly synchronize changes with GitHub.
